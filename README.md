# FA-FGB
Code and results of my PhD second chapter (Fluctuating Asymmetry and Feather Growth Bars).

Folder "2.code" contains all the scripts used for data manipulation and calculation/measurement of variables used in the analysis. The scripts are named in order of how they should be read/run (e.g. 01, 02, 03...);

Folder "2.data_model" contains csv files with the final data for model fitting;

Folder "2.notebook" contains the notebooks with statistical analysis for each of FA and FGB.
